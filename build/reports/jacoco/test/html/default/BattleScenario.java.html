     /**
      * TO DO: Implement for Assignment 3
      * This method implements the calculation of damage for one specific attack.
      * One monster attacks with the given damage, the dealt damage is then calculated through
      * (pAttackDamage * pAttacker.attack * pAttacker.weatherBonus * pAttacker.typeBonus) -
                (pDefender.stats.defense * pDefender.weatherBonus * pDefender.typeBonus)
      * If the initial pAttackDamage is 0, then the damage dealt is 0. If the totalDamage calculated
      * is negative, the totalDamage dealt should be 1. Any positive value is the total damage dealt.
      * Weather bonus: see the Environment which you can assume is correct. You need to check though if the weather bonus is applied 
      * correctly, since maybe the method does not use the environment correctly. 
      * or debuffed based on the weather. EG. fire monsters have a stat advantage of +25% in sunny weather
      * while they have a stat disadvantage of -25% in the rain.
      * If the attack chosen, matches the monsters type, the attacker will get an extra 20% on its attack.
      * Type bonus: Certain monsters have an attack bonus against others:
      *     Fire against Water: Water gains 25% while Fire looses 25%
      *     Fire against Ground: Fire gains 25% while Ground looses 25%
      *     Ground against Water: Ground gains 25% while Water looses 25%
      *     Normal mon: never gain any type bonus and are weaker during droughts.
      * These bonuses do not stack up, they are just applied for every attack. 
      * @param pAttack is the attack value given to the method where that attack value is based on the 
      *                 monsters damage value
      * @param pAttacker the attacking monster
      * @param pDefender the defending monster (the defending monster will never get damage)
      * to calculate damage output.
      * @return total damage output
